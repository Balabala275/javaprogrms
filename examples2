AIM: To create collectibles and a scoring system in Unity (C#).
● Create collectible items (like coins).
● Implement a scoring system.
● Display the score on the UI.
PROCEDURE
Step 1: Set Up The Scene
1. Open the Unity project.
2. Create a 3D Object → Plane (for the ground).
3. Create a 3D Object → Player (e.g., a Capsule).
4. Create a 3D Object → Sphere (Collectible item).
Assign tags:
○ Select the player → Tag it as Player.
○ Create a new tag called Collectible and assign it to the collectible spheres.
Step 2: Add Collider and Rigidbody
● Ensure the Player has a Rigidbody (for movement and collision).
● Ensure the Collectible has a Collider (check Is Trigger) so it can detect overlaps.
Step 3: Create the Score Manager Script
Make a central script to handle the score.
Create a new C# script: ScoreManager.cs
Attach it to an empty GameObject named GameManager.
ScoreManager.cs
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;
public class ScoreManager : MonoBehaviour
{
 public static ScoreManager instance; // Singleton for easy access
 public Text scoreText;
 private int score = 0;
 void Awake()
 {
 // Ensure only one instance exists
 if (instance == null)
 instance = this;
else
 Destroy(gameObject);
 }
 void Start()
 {
 UpdateScoreText();
 }
 public void AddScore(int points)
 {
 score += points;
 UpdateScoreText();
 }
 private void UpdateScoreText()
 {
 scoreText.text = "Score: " + score;
 }
}
Step 4: Create the Collectible Script
Create a new C# script: Collectible.cs
Attach it to each collectible item.
Collectible.cs
using UnityEngine;
public class Collectible : MonoBehaviour
{
 public int points = 10; // Points for collecting
 private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
 {
 if (other.CompareTag("Player"))
 {
 // Add score
 ScoreManager.instance.AddScore(points);
 // Destroy collectible
 Destroy(gameObject);
 }
 }
}
Step 5: Create the UI for Score Display
1. Go to Hierarchy → UI → Text (Legacy) or UI → Text - TextMeshPro.
2. Rename it to ScoreText.
3. Position it at the top corner of the screen.
4. In the GameManager (where the ScoreManager script is attached):
○ Drag the ScoreText from the hierarchy into the Score Text field in the inspector.
Step 6: Test the Game
● Play the scene.
● Move the player to collide with the collectibles.
● The collectibles should disappear, and the score should update on the UI.
Step 7 (Optional): Add Player Movement for Testing
Create a script called PlayerMovement.cs:
PlayerMovement.cs
using UnityEngine;
public class PlayerMovement : MonoBehaviour
{
 public float speed = 5f;
 void Update()
 {
 float moveX = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
 float moveZ = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
 Vector3 move = new Vector3(moveX, 0, moveZ) * speed * Time.deltaTime;
 transform.Translate(move, Space.World);
 }
}
Attach it to the Player object.
RESULT
When it plays:
● The player moves with arrow keys or WASD.
● When the player touches a collectible, it disappears.
● The score increases and updates on the UI instantly.
